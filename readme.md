# Local Chromecast Streamer

The purpose of this app is to make it easier for you to use Google Chrome to stream local video files on your hard drive onto your Chromecast Device.

### Instructions

* Clone or download this repo to a local folder.
* In your terminal, go to your local folder and do "npm install"
* Copy/move your video files to the "vids" folder
* Then in your terminal do "node app.js"

#### If you run into challenges, make sure you have at least node v8.0.0 installed. This will probably work on 6.1.0 but wasn't tested there.
